###Questions for Studiocracy
**Response by Chris Robles 07/14/15 via Slack**
  * What is the preferred language to be used for creating an analytics fact table?
    - We use postgreSQL for our db's
  * For the current tables shown in your db schema is there a meta data file describing the fields?
    - As for a file describing all the fields in our schema I would have to check. We are planning on doing some cleanup on our db so we would have to make sure to update you guys.
  * Do you currently have content within your tables that we could have access to for testing?
    - For content in the tables we're using generated dummy content created by the seeds.rb file under db folder, we can add some additional content to it so that it better covers all the fields.
  * Is there a preferred color pallet for visuals?
    - As far as a color pallet, I can talk to our designers and see if they have anything in mind.
  * In regards to the location of the dashboards on which page will it be displayed?
    - The analytics table will be in an admin page. But we also like the idea of having one accessible to users so that they can see statistics on their content.
  * Show mock-up of the artist dashboard for initial suggestions.
    - Generally the mock up looks good, it's what we're looking for.
  * Is Tableau the preferred software for analytics?
    - Tableau looks like it'll work great.
  * What are the requirements for admin dashboard?
   - The purpose of the dashboards is for us to track statistics of our user base, and for artist to track statistics on their content. I'll bring it up at tomorrow's meeting and talk to our designers to discuss specifics on how it should look, and we'll figure out exactly what statistics we'd be looking to track.
